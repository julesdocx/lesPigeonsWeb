                    Activate and inspire the very talented but dystopian minded youth, inflicted by the climate crisis, covid, social media and many other problems that rose up the surface. We want to prove our talent and visions not only to the outside world, but also to ourselves.

                </h3>

                    What do we do that you don’t? What do we feel that you don’t? What do we know that you don’t? What do we think that you don’t? What do we see that you don’t?

                <h3>A reaction against the academic system</h3>
                <p>
                    We tend to hide our mistakes to get our grades up. We tend to be afraid to make mistakes that could get our grades down. We become afraid of the doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As this is a festival and network of the young, we find it of great importance that there is a certain freedom protected for personal input to motivate experimentation and creativity.
